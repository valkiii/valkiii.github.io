      <description>I recently had the opportunity to have an intersting conversation with Jo√£o Querido and Solaiyappan Shanmugam regarding the challenging move from Individual contributor (aka senior data scientist in my case) to leading a team. You can listen to this coversation in the last episode of the podcast Bind2Tech hosted by Waheed Najimi. Hope you enjoy listening to it as much I did doing it!</description>
